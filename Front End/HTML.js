Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.
// Local Storage
	//**** persistant 
	// stores data with no expiration date
	//two types
		// 'default' = stores things in name/value pairs
		// Web SQL (aka Web Database) = uses a SQL database

// Session Storage 
	// non persistent, stores data for one session
	// scoped only to the current window (stores data for one session)

// Cookies = the old school way of doing session stories. Stores name/value pairs per domain.

// Web Storage is more secure and faster. The data is not included with every server request, but used ONLY when asked for. It is also possible to store large amounts of data, without affecting the website's performance.
