 Object oriented programming

// In classical inheritance, classes are immutable, may or may not support multiple inheritance, and may contain interfaces, final classes, and abstract classes. 
//In contrast, prototypes are much more flexible in the sense that they may be mutable or immutable. The object may inherit from multiple prototypes, and only contains objects.

Prototypes
	// the object prototype is passes methods to the inheritors: functions, arrays, strings and numbers
	// the highest ancestor is the object prototype
	// prototype chain
	// helpful for memory issues, inherit from one location, one storage
	// so if you want to build a function for all strings, make it a String.prototype.method


1. What is OOPS?

OOPS is abbreviated as Object Oriented Programming system in which programs are considered as a collection of objects. Each object is nothing but an instance of a class.
