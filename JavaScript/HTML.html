32. Describe the difference between cookies, sessionStorage, and localStorage.

Cookies are small text files that websites place in a browser for tracking or login purposes.

To link an image, use <img> tags. You need specify the image in quotes using the source attribute, src in the opening tag.

Little known fact: href stands for “hypertext reference.” When linking to an email, the href specification will be “mailto:send@here.com.” See examples below:
<img src=”HTMLrocks.jpg”></img>

Semantic HTML is a coding style where the tags embody what the text is meant to convey. In Semantic HTML, tags like <b></b> for bold, and <i></i> for italic should not be used, reason being they just represent formatting, and provide no indication of meaning or structure.

It has a number of new elements, supports offline data storage for applications, and has more robust exchange protocols. Thus, proprietary plug-in technologies like Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, Apache Pivot, and Sun JavaFX are no longer needed, because browsers can now process these elements without additional requirements.
